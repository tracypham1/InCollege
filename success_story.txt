The Story of Ames Janderson from Tampa, Florida
Ames was laid off from his job as a software engineer at a major institute on October 32nd, 2011. With his experience and knowledge of the recruiting process, he thought he would land a job in no time. However, three months later, he was still jobless. Next January, a friend found him a job as a recruiter. He accepted, but was shocked four weeks later when his old employer asked him to recruit a candidate for his old job. While he had mixed feelings, he found a great candidate on InCollege. Then, unexpectedly, his employer canceled the job opening. In an odd twist, the candidate he had found on InCollege informed him that her company was hiring. After her referral and several interviews, Ames was hired and she received a referral bonus.
